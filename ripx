                        <h3>January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018 <br> known professionally as XXXTentacion was an American rapper,
                            singer and songwriter. A controversial figure within the hip hop industry,
                            Onfroy has been regarded to have left behind "a huge musical footprint"
                            due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his short career.
                            His most notable appearance was his tattoos and his distinctive half-colored hair,
                            which was inspired by the One Hundred and One Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil.</h3>

                        <h3>
                            Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy was born on January 23, 1998,
                            in Plantation, Florida, to Jamaican parents, Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy and Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard.
                            Onfroy has stated he has Egyptian, Syrian, Indian and possibly Italian ancestry in an interview on The Beat in 2017.
                            He had three siblings with one being half, shared paternally.[34] Onfroy was mainly raised by his grandmother Collette Jones—due to his mother's financial situation—in
                            Pompano Beach, Florida, and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he tried to stab a man attempting to attack his mothe
                            and was eventually put into a youth program before being forced to live with his grandmother.

            <!--                Onfroy's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir.
                            He was soon kicked out of the school choir after attacking another student.
                            Onfroy attended Margate Middle School from which he was later expelled after a series of physical altercations.
                            He was subsequently enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mother for over six months.
                            Onfroy began to listen to nu-metal, hard rock and rap during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him to learn the piano and guitar.

                            Onfroy attended Piper High School until he dropped out in the tenth grade.
                            He described himself as a "misfit" during that time, citing how quiet he was despite being popular and regularly involved in physical confrontations.
                            Onfroy was not the athletic type and said that he was insecure and depressed during his time in high school.
