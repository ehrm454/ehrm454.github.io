                        <h3>Tentacion was born on January 23, 1998 in Florida and was never an ordinary child.
                            Tentacion had three brothers, all of whom had different mothers, and his father left him when he was four.
                            At that time, the young Tentasion was often beaten by his father without knowing the English language, and because of this poor and violent family environment,
                            he fought aggressively from a young age, and in the year when he turned six, a man ran to the man, trying to stab and stab him because he had touched his mother.
                           <!-- Since childhood, due to financial problems in the family, she has been raised in a house other than her parents' house or her grandmother's house,
                            and she still has a lot of attachment to her grandmother.--></h3>

                            After a while, the reason he first became interested in music in such an unhappy home environment was because of his aunt,
                            who persistently persuaded Tentasion not to attend the school choir and church choir,
                            and reluctantly attended the tentacion soon after attacking another student,
                            but that was the first time he was expelled from the school and music. Before I knew it,
                            he entered middle school, but there were also violent and abnormal behaviors.

                            he barely managed to graduate from other middle schools again,
                            and then his mother enrolled him in an academy called 'Sheridian House Family Ministries' for more than six months,
                            where he began to learn metal hard rock, piano and so on. Maybe that's when Tentasion decided to start music,
                            but he dropped out of high school in 2014 to start music seriously.
