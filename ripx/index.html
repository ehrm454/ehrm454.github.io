                        <h3>Tentacion was born on January 23, 1998 in Florida and was never an ordinary child.
                            Tentacion had three brothers, all of whom had different mothers, and his father left him when he was four.
                            At that time, the young Tentasion was often beaten by his father without knowing the English language, and because of this poor and violent family environment,
                            he fought aggressively from a young age, and in the year when he turned six, a man ran to the man, trying to stab and stab him because he had touched his mother.
                           <!-- Since childhood, due to financial problems in the family, she has been raised in a house other than her parents' house or her grandmother's house,
                            and she still has a lot of attachment to her grandmother.--></h3>

                            who persistently persuaded Tentasion not to attend the school choir and church choir,
                            and reluctantly attended the tentacion soon after attacking another student,
                            but that was the first time he was expelled from the school and music. Before I knew it,
                            he entered middle school, but there were also violent and abnormal behaviors.

                            and then his mother enrolled him in an academy called 'Sheridian House Family Ministries' for more than six months,
                            where he began to learn metal hard rock, piano and so on. Maybe that's when Tentasion decided to start music,
                            but he dropped out of high school in 2014 to start music seriously.

                            depressing, emotional and calm piece of music that contrasts the mood with
                            "Look At Me!" to the point that he feels the same person is right.

                            In particular, if you listen to the songs of 17 or `?' you
                            can see that they were influenced by punk rock or alternative rock.
                            If you think about hip-hop, you might think of it, it's music based
                            on alternative rock, punk rock, etc., and music based on instruments
                            such as piano, acoustic guitar, etc., that doesn't mix hip-hop with hip-hop's
                            original sound. This sets the difference between other rappers and even hip-hop
                            virtuoso Kanye West said he was inspired by ``I haven't told you how much inspiration
                            you've given me'' on Twitter since Tentasion was shot to death. His musical talent has been so
                            unrivaled that there has been no and never will be any pop, Al&B and acoustic artists, including
                            hip-hop, which is often represented by white music.

                            Tentasion's rap style features a flow of high-tones that seems to carry
                            emotions and spit them out on the basis of solid vocalization. Born in 1998,
                            he is one of his younger generation, but his voice sounds younger than his age.
                            He sings as well as his rap skills. In particular, he featured in songs that were close to
                            electronic pop, titled "A Again" by Miley Cyrus' brother, Noah Cyrus, which seems to
                            be more interested in various genres such as rock music, pop songs, and Al & B rather
                            than being tied to a single genre of hip-hop, and made it his own album.

                            The lyrics are also one of his differences with other rappers, with most of them
                            writing extravagant lives such as money bragging, tea bragging and women bragging,
                            while Tentasion takes out the sensibility of deep depression that lurks within him and writes
                            it into the lyrics. I think these differentiated musical genres and lyrics have created the position
                            of the current Ten Tasion.

                            Among the songs, "Joceline Flores" is the name of a woman whom Tentasion met on social media,
                            the last person she saw before she committed suicide. So Tentasion always turned pessimistic when he
                            thought about her and said he felt so much emotion that he kept getting tied up with her.
                            Even after releasing the song, he communicated with fans through Instagram live to find answers to the song.

                        On March 1, the official singles 'SAD!' and 'changes' were released, and on March 16, his second album ? was released.
            <br>
                        She once again cemented her position as a mainstream rapper, boasting her musically high perfection and receiving great acclaim from the public and critics, but it was her last album of her life three months later as she went on the way to not be able to return due to an unexpected robbery.
<br>
                        The music video for his song "SAD!" was released around 10:30 p.m. on June 28 in Korea. Watching the music video, the current hairstyle and tattooed tentacion appear at the funeral of the former hair-style tentacion, where the dead body of the tentacion is resurrected in a coffin and fights the tentacion. The old X who died here on a video with his old hairstyle means that the devil inside him doesn't die easily. Many people feel that this scene is a posthumous video. To give a detailed interpretation, the former hair-style tentacion, or the death-returning tentacion, is the violent tentacion at the time of "Look At Me!" and the tentacion facing him is the tentacion that reflects on the current self.

        <img style="width:100%; height:auto; margin:0 auto;     display: inherit; max-width:400px; max-height:900px;" id="section004" src="https://cdn.spinrilla.com/albums/79130/large/ace2c61c1b16a6778248.jpg?1531435297" />

            <br><br>
            At around 3:30 p.m. on June 18, 2018,
            X was shot dead at 5:30 p.m. by two unidentified men in a black Dodge Jr.
            while driving out of a motorcycle shop in Miami's Deerfield Beach. When the first news came out,<br>
            the fans could have had even a word of hope due to the news such as
            "I'm being taken to the hospital because I don't have any breathing,"<br>
            but it was finally pronounced dead after being taken to the hospital. Witnesses
            say he was robbed of his Louis Vuitton bag and cash in the car.
            Therefore, there is speculation that the murder was committed by a robber who sought money.<br>
            <br><br>
            Immediately after the incident, information about the suspect was released
            through Florida sheriffs. The suspect was a two-man armed robber, and
            the shooter wore a red mask. Based on this information, people found
            a strong suspect who killed X on Instagram. Rapper Salier Kidd's Instagram
            account, "Soldier.Kidd," posted a photo from Florida before the incident,
            with two (Soldier Kidd himself and fellow Soldier Jojo) sitting on a car, and a
            red mask on the passenger seat. In addition, the name of the album released
            on May 2, 2018 is "XXX." Now, if you go into that account on June 20, 2018,
            Goldier Kidd posted a video explaining that he wasn't the murderer of XXX
            Tentacion and that he was paying his respects to his family, but many people
            think that he killed X because his feelings are so clear.
            <br><br>
            But on June 21, only three days after his death, the real killer was caught.
            It has been confirmed that Goldier Kid, who had been previously identified as a
            criminal, was not , and it is assumed that the red mask and the duo were actually rumors.
            Photos of mug shots and information about criminals are being posted on the Internet.
            The 22-year-old tattooist, Dedrick D. Williams, is said to have been in and out of police stations
            several times already for cocaine possession and gun possession. Michael Boatright,
            who was indicted along with him, claims no testimony has been delivered to prove his innocence.
            <br><br>
            Aside from their controversial acts of life, many people lament the sudden
            death of their children while they are building their position musically by
            blossoming talent at a young age of 20. Many hip-hop musicians and international artists,
            including Kanye West, Offset, Takeoff, Lil Pump, Lille Jan, Diplo, Steve Aoki, Lille Yati, Noah
            Cyrus, Joy Badass, Denzel Curry, Kodak Black, J-Coll and Marshmallow, are also paying tribute
            to him, who died so abruptly. Even more regrettable was the fact that he was shot two hours
            later after posting his Instagram account that he was visiting Florida for a charity event.
            <br><br>
            His death is so shocking that some speculate that he may not have died, but
            there is little evidence and is sufficiently rebuttable. The government made an
            official announcement and even a Tentacion official and his mother acknowledged
            his death. There seems to be such a conspiracy theory as much as his death is regrettable.
            There are also many bad cases, such as posting such conspiracy theories on Facebook
            and other websites and turning them into ads, taking advantage of the fact that shocked
            enthusiasts have a real hope for such conspiracy theories. This conspiracy theory is nothing
            more than a means of making money for bad people. If you are really a fan, don't believe in this
            groundless conspiracy theory and let's mourn it.
            <br><br>
            The song 'SAD!' from his second album after
            his death has topped the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. This is
            the first time that the Billboard chart has topped since his death in
            1997 (the eighth time in history). a billboard article
            <br><br>
            In the music video of "SAD!," he comes to the funeral of the former
            Tentasion wearing clothes that are not considered funeral attire, which
            shows he has no intention of accepting or understanding of his past violent
            acts and appearances. This self-reflection, the Ten Tacion fights outside the
            church where the funeral was going on, where the present Ten Tacion uses a
            force of salt to easily subdue the old Tentacion. There are many opinions here
            that the heart power is Naruto's Omaju.[16] In the end, what I wanted to say in this
            music video was to say that Tentacion repented for his past wrongdoing, and was
            born a new man different from the past.
            <br><br>
            It was all the more shocking to hear that rapper Jimmy Warppo, one of the
            candidates for the 2018 XXL Freshman, was shot dead the same day.
            <br><br>
            He wrote a will last November, and all his legacy was given to his mother.
            <br><br>
            It is very similar to The Notorious B.I.G. that as a rapper, he died young,
            shot dead by an unidentified man, and passed away before his fullness.
            It is very similar to the high influence, the posthumous No. 1 spot on the
            Billboard chart, and the fact that only two full-length albums have been released.
