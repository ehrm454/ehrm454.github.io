                        <h3>Tentacion was born on January 23, 1998 in Florida and was never an ordinary child.
                            Tentacion had three brothers, all of whom had different mothers, and his father left him when he was four.
                            At that time, the young Tentasion was often beaten by his father without knowing the English language, and because of this poor and violent family environment,
                            he fought aggressively from a young age, and in the year when he turned six, a man ran to the man, trying to stab and stab him because he had touched his mother.
                           <!-- Since childhood, due to financial problems in the family, she has been raised in a house other than her parents' house or her grandmother's house,
                            and she still has a lot of attachment to her grandmother.--></h3>

                            who persistently persuaded Tentasion not to attend the school choir and church choir,
                            and reluctantly attended the tentacion soon after attacking another student,
                            but that was the first time he was expelled from the school and music. Before I knew it,
                            he entered middle school, but there were also violent and abnormal behaviors.

                            he barely managed to graduate from other middle schools again,
                            and then his mother enrolled him in an academy called 'Sheridian House Family Ministries' for more than six months,
                            where he began to learn metal hard rock, piano and so on. Maybe that's when Tentasion decided to start music,
                            but he dropped out of high school in 2014 to start music seriously.

                            thought about her and said he felt so much emotion that he kept getting tied up with her.
                            Even after releasing the song, he communicated with fans through Instagram live to find answers to the song.

                        On March 1, the official singles 'SAD!' and 'changes' were released, and on March 16, his second album ? was released.
            <br>
                        She once again cemented her position as a mainstream rapper, boasting her musically high perfection and receiving great acclaim from the public and critics, but it was her last album of her life three months later as she went on the way to not be able to return due to an unexpected robbery.
<br>
                        The music video for his song "SAD!" was released around 10:30 p.m. on June 28 in Korea. Watching the music video, the current hairstyle and tattooed tentacion appear at the funeral of the former hair-style tentacion, where the dead body of the tentacion is resurrected in a coffin and fights the tentacion. The old X who died here on a video with his old hairstyle means that the devil inside him doesn't die easily. Many people feel that this scene is a posthumous video. To give a detailed interpretation, the former hair-style tentacion, or the death-returning tentacion, is the violent tentacion at the time of "Look At Me!" and the tentacion facing him is the tentacion that reflects on the current self.       </h3>
